# Scan Components

This script uses react-scanner to count the uses of components in the webapp.

It's used to track our adoption of @sonarsource/echoes-react.

## Run

Simply run

```sh
yarn scan-components
```

This generates a CSV file here: `.componentscan/components.csv`.

This CSV data is meant to suit a dedicated spreadsheet to track adoption over time: `State of Echoes adoption 25Q3-4`.

Reach out to the FEE squad if you want access.
