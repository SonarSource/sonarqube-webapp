// The category tags a navigable standard can be filed under. `All` is the sidebar's
// "show everything" option rather than a category a standard belongs to, so
// ComplianceReportNavigationCategory excludes it.
//
// This lives in a plain (no-React) helper so that non-component modules — notably the
// security-standards registry — can reference the tag values without importing a React
// component. The filter component re-exports these for ergonomic filter-side imports.
